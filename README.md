## Implementation of the Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machine Neural Network Algorithm using Variational Methods




### Problem Description

The problem of approimating the statistics of a thermal state of a given hamiltonian is a largely and expensive computational problem in Statritcal Physics. 

For a given Ising hamiltonian: ![Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 4 42 58 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30132476/162616395-72185b4f-a1fd-46e5-8665-36631eb8302f.png) ![Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 4 43 42 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30132476/162616421-c2e74594-56b1-4b90-ba1f-bb71995cb223.png)

We have to find a set of states ![Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 4 44 20 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30132476/162616445-5ad822c8-da39-4bbe-9da7-b015d45a0df9.png) where ![Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 4 44 46 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30132476/162616459-8200105b-39ee-4509-b9d4-d2270183a846.png) is a set of variational parameters for the state preparation ansatz that we must find and optimize using the QRBM Algorithm.
